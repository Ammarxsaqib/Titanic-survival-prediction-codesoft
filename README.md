# Titanic-survival-prediction-codesoft

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd titanic-survival-prediction
Download the Titanic dataset as a CSV file and place it in the project directory with the name tested.csv.

Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python titanic_survival_prediction.py
Overview
Data Loading: The script begins by loading the Titanic dataset from the tested.csv file using pandas.

Data Preprocessing:

Rows with missing values are dropped from the dataset.
Feature engineering is performed to extract titles from passenger names and create a new feature 'Title'.
'Title' values are categorized into common categories (e.g., 'Mr', 'Miss', 'Mrs', 'Master', 'Rare').
A new feature 'FamilySize' is created by adding 'SibSp' and 'Parch'.
Unnecessary columns ('PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'Age') are dropped from the dataset.
Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding.
Data Splitting: The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.

Feature Scaling: Numeric features ('Fare' and 'FamilySize') are standardized using StandardScaler.

Model Training:

A Random Forest Classifier is initialized.
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation:

The best model is used to make predictions on the test set.
Classification report and confusion matrix are printed to evaluate the model's performance.
Visualizations:

Several visualizations are created using seaborn and matplotlib to explore the data:
Survival count by gender
Survival rate by passenger class
Survival rate by title
